## Overview
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze tweets and classify their sentiment. It is designed to provide real-time sentiment insights, making it a powerful tool for businesses, marketers, and researchers.

Key features:

- Preprocessing of tweet text data.

- Sentiment classification using advanced machine learning models.

- Interactive web application for real-time predictions.
---

## Motivation
Sentiment analysis of tweets enables organizations to:

- Understand public opinion on various topics.

- Monitor brand perception in real time.

- Identify trending issues and user sentiments.

- This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP and machine learning to analyze social media content.

---

## Technical Aspect
### Training Machine Learning Models:
Training Machine Learning Models:

Data Collection:

- Tweets are collected using the Twitter API or publicly available datasets.

Preprocessing:

- Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.

- Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

- Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF or Word2Vec.

Model Training:

- Models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or BERT.

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Model Evaluation:

- Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Building and Hosting a Flask Web App:

- A Flask-based web app processes user-inputted tweets and displays predictions.

- Deployed on Render for public access.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

```
# Install dependencies: (all lib)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Run
To train the Machine leaning models:
 To run the Flask web app locally
```bash
python webapp/app.py

```
# Deployment on Render

## To deploy the Flask web app on Render:
Deployment on Render

- To deploy the web app on Render:

- Push your code to GitHub.

- Log in to Render and create a new web service.

- Connect the GitHub repository.

- Configure environment variables (if any).

- Deploy and access your app live.
